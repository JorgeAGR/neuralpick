# neuralpick
Phase picking and quality checking library for use with seismic data. Experimental Python wrapper tool that allow users to train and use computer vision models for characterizing their own seismic waveform data sets\

WIP, currently halted due to work conflicts of interest.\

Created by Jorge A Garcia, 2020\

Train your own model, which can be used to pick seismic phases in new seismograms.\
